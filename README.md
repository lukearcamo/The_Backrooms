# The_Backrooms
Renders an animated scene of The Backrooms (https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-backrooms) in your browser.

The scene fully procedural, all written in a small fragment shader using raymarching.
This only uses THREE.js to render a quad, so in theory it could run on pure WebGL but I don't want to write verbose code just to set it up.
To run it, just run the Backrooms.html file in a browser.
