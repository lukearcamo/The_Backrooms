# The Backrooms
Renders an animated scene of The Backrooms (https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-backrooms) in your browser.

The scene fully procedural, all written in a small fragment shader using raymarching.
This only uses THREE.js to render a quad, so in theory it could run on pure WebGL but i really don't want to write all of the verbose code needed to set it up.

To run it, just open the Backrooms.html file using a browser.
